# ClimAg: Multifactorial causes of fodder crises in Ireland and risks due to climate change

![ClimAg project logos](/images/logos.png)

ClimAg is a three-year research project funded by the [Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.ie/) under the Climate Change Research Programme grant number 2018-CCRP-MS.50.

This GitHub organisation hosts the project's repositories and is maintained by [Nithiya Streethran](https://github.com/nmstreethran) (Research Assistant, [Environmental Research Institute (ERI)](https://eri.ucc.ie), [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie)).

## Goals

ClimAg is examining past fodder crises such as the 2018 dry summer and placing them in the context of long-term climate change.

ClimAg seeks to identify the multifactorial drivers of fodder crises by:

- developing a detailed understanding of the multiple interlinked drivers of previous fodder crises affecting the Irish agricultural sector
- combining datasets from 21st century climate simulations with grass growth models to predict the frequency and severity of fodder crisis events under future climate change scenarios
