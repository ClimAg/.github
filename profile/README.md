# ClimAg: Multifactorial causes of fodder crises in Ireland and risks due to climate change

[ClimAg](https://www.ucc.ie/en/eel/projects/climag/) is a three-year research project funded by the [Environment Protection Agency (EPA), Ireland](https://www.epa.ie/) under the Climate Change Research Programme grant number 2018-CCRP-MS.50.

The goals of this project are:

- to develop a detailed understanding of the multiple interlinked drivers of previous fodder crises affecting the Irish agricultural sector
- to make projections of the future frequency and severity of such crises based on climate simulations and grass production models
