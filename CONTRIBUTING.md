## Get started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up a repository for local development.

1.  Fork the repository on GitHub.
1.  Clone your fork locally:
1.  Create a branch for local development:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

1. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

## Pull request guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests (if applicable).
1.  If the pull request adds functionality, the documentation should be
    updated. If you added a new Python function, include a docstring with the
    function, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
1.  Make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions
    (if applicable).
