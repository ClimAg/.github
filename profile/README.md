ClimAg is examining past fodder crises such as the 2018 dry summer and placing them in the context of long-term climate change.
ClimAg seeks to identify the multifactorial drivers of fodder crises by:

- developing a detailed understanding of the multiple interlinked drivers of previous fodder crises affecting the Irish agricultural sector
- combining datasets from 21st century climate simulations with grass growth models to predict the frequency and severity of fodder crisis events under future climate change scenarios

This research project was carried out at the [Environmental Research Institute (ERI)](https://eri.ucc.ie), [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie) between 2019 and 2023.
This GitHub organisation hosts repositories for ClimAg and other related projects and is maintained by Nithiya Streethran.
